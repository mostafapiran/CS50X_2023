If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

To calculate the sound aura, we can use an artificial intelligence system to adjust the coefficients of an artist's musical characteristics.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

We may not be able to collect enough and suitable data from the audience to train our neural network.
But if we can collect a suitable data set to determine the coefficients for calculating the sound halo of artificial intelligence and neural network or deep learning, I think it is a suitable method.
